Introduzione
---------------

This is a Salesforce component that can be used to tabulate data retrieved from a query. Thanks to its versatility, it can be utilized to create dynamic tables, allowing for pagination of query results, sorting data based on specific criteria, and filtering data instantly through a full-text search field. Completely configurable via "Lightning App Builder" or "Flow," it does not require additional development.
